5.0.10.0 Code is a long term support code release and it came out after the 5.1.4.200. The release versioning and merging of code didn't line up so we are on a newer version of code than the version would suggest.



No plan to integrate HTML5 into 5.0.x, support is pushing for this, but engineering does not want to backfill the code banks for this feature.
5.2 has full support for HTML5 and the plugins
They have to have a specific amount of arrays running the GA Candidate and a certain threshold of tickets per code release.
5.2 adds Fan Out replication
5.2 adds controller upgrade path from AF5000 to AF60 (offline upgrade)
5.2 adds storage class memory for caching on AF60, goes directly into the controller
